## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

_Also, please don't edit elastic.js and elastic.min.js files as they are generated via grunt. You'll find source code in the "src" subdirectory!_
